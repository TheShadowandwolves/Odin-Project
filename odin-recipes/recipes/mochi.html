    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This easy mochi recipe is a delightful treat that combines chewy rice cake with a
    sweet filling. Perfect for satisfying your dessert cravings!</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup glutinous rice flour (mochiko)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>Cornstarch or potato starch (for dusting)</li>
        <li>Sweet filling of your choice (e.g., red bean paste, ice cream, fruit)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a microwave-safe bowl, combine glutinous rice flour and sugar. Gradually add water while stirring until the mixture is smooth and free of lumps.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, leaving a small vent for steam to escape. Microwave on high for 1 minute. Remove and stir the mixture. Repeat this process two more times, microwaving for 1 minute and stirring each time, until the mochi is thick and slightly translucent.</li>
        <li>Dust a clean surface with cornstarch or potato starch. Carefully transfer the hot mochi onto the dusted surface. Be cautious as it will be very hot.</li>
        <li>Let the mochi cool for a few minutes until it is safe to handle. Once cooled, divide the mochi into small portions (about 8-10 pieces).</li>
        <li>Flatten each portion into a round disc using your hands or a rolling pin dusted with starch. Place a small amount of your chosen filling in the center of each disc.</li>
        <li>Carefully fold the edges of the mochi over the filling and pinch to seal. Shape into a ball or desired shape.</li>
        <li>Dust off any excess starch and serve immediately, or store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 day. Enjoy your homemade mochi!</li>
